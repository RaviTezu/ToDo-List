# go-todo
Just a ToDo list of tasks that I would like to solve to using Go

Tasks: 
- [] Elastic IP failover from one instance to other instance using Go
  - [] Should read the nodes from a config file. 
  - [] There should be a log to know, what happened. 
  - [] Comeup with an Idle Timeout for the EIP failover. 
  - [] There's shouldn't be any race conditions for the IP. 

- [] More to come ...
