# go-todo
Just a ToDo list of tasks that I would like to solve to using Go

Tasks: 
- [ ] Elastic IP failover from one instance to other instance using Go
  - [ ] Should read the nodes from a config file. 
  - [ ] There should be a log to know, what happened. 
  - [ ] Comeup with an Idle Timeout for the EIP failover. 
  - [ ] There's shouldn't be any race conditions for the IP. 

- [ ] Simple and Free API which would send PNs to your android mobile.
  - [ ] Should be using some kind of Auth tokens.
  - [ ] You may need a simple Android App as well.
