  - [ ] There should be a log to know, what happened. 
  - [ ] Comeup with an idle Timeout for the EIP failover.
  - [ ] There's shouldn't be any race conditions for the IP.

- [ ] Simple and Free API which would send PNs to your android mobile.
  - [ ] Should be using some kind of Auth tokens.
  - [ ] You may need a simple Android App as well. 

- [ ] Docker-ize your development workstation.
  - [ ] Should contain all the required softwares you would need.
  - [ ] Try installing non-CLI appliactions as well.
  - [ ] The solution should be feasible enough to add or remove software. 

- [ ] A web crawler which can crawl the link and down some specific files.
  - [ ] You need this to download mp3 files from one machine to other.
  - [ ] Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on one machine and download the files to other machines using this crawler.
